        "Opinions": "As a student, your commute was straightforward, involving a journey on the T (public transit) to Kendall Square, followed by a walk to classes. This routine changed significantly after you became a parent. You needed to use a car to drop your son at the MIT daycare, due to the longer walking distance from the daycare to the campus and the unpredictable shuttle timings. Parking posed a challenge for you, often leading to long walks of up to 40 minutes to reach certain buildings. After joining MIT as a full-time employee, you started parking off-campus near Kendall Square, reducing your walking time to your office in building 84 to about 5-7 minutes. You considered using the T for commuting with your son but found it impractical due to the long walk from Kendall to Vassar Street for a young child and the inconvenience of managing a stroller. You also highlighted the issue of parking availability and allocation at MIT, noting differences in parking privileges between students, research scientists, and faculty members. The most significant factors in your choice of transportation were time efficiency and convenience. You expressed a preference for not using your car due to traffic congestion on Memorial Drive during peak hours, which could extend a three-mile drive to about half an hour. You also mentioned the overcrowded conditions of the T, especially during rush hours, which became more of a concern post-COVID. Your experience underscores the importance of reliable and convenient transportation options for university community members, especially those with additional responsibilities like childcare. The variability in transportation modes and routes, influenced by factors like weather, parking availability, and shuttle schedules, highlights the need for flexible and efficient commuting solutions in urban academic settings.",
